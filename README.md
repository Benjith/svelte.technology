## Running locally

This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to manage dependencies.

Set up the project:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sveltejs/svelte.technology.git
cd svelte.technology
yarn
```

Build everything:

```bash
yarn run prep
```

Run Rollup in watch mode and start the server:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

This process is a little bit clunky and may change in future.
