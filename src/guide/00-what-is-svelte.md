title: What is Svelte?
---

If you've ever built a JavaScript application, the chances are you've encountered – or at least heard of – frameworks like React, Angular, Vue and Ractive. Like Svelte, these tools all share a goal of making it easy to build slick interactive user interfaces.

But Svelte has a crucial difference: rather than interpreting your application code at *run time*, your components are converted into ideal JavaScript at *build time*. That means you don't pay the performance cost of the framework's abstractions, or incur a penalty when your app first loads.

And because there's no overhead, you can easily adopt Svelte in an existing app incrementally, or ship your components as standalone packages that work anywhere.

In short: **Svelte heralds a new era of JavaScript application development.**


### Getting started

Normally, this is the part where the instructions would tell you to add a `<script>` tag to your page or install something from npm. But because Svelte runs at build time, it works a little bit differently.
